            <h4 class = "text">Hello! My name is Quinn Samms and I'm a junior Computer Science and Engieering major at Santa Clara University. 
                I was born in Mountain View, California but I've lived most of my life in Gilbert, Arizona where I currently live with my 
                parents and older brother. I got interested in CS from messing with computers when I was young(and playing lots of video games). 
                I became facinated with such complex machines and wanted to understand them. I love watching baseball and basketball(Giants and Suns are my teams), 
                working out, and spending time with those I care about. Additonally, I have a strong passion for knowlege and growth and I always love 
                to learn new things from new people.
