            <h4 class = "text">This project is a simple spelling bee game that is based off the New York Times spellling bee game. The 
                Game asks the user for a username and the user must provide as many words as possible from the given hive of letters. Each word must start with one
                of the given letters and must be at least 3 characers long and is checked with a dictionary API to ensure it is a valid word. 
                A timer counts down from 1 minute and once their time is done, the user's score and words are 
                stored in a mySQL database. Past games scores and words provided can be seen on the leaderboard page from the main menu screen.
