            <h4 class = "text">As seen in the demo, the program asks the user for a job title, location, and keywords to search for in order to match the user 
                with a compatible job. The program searches on indeed for jobs that match this description and gives the user information on each found job, including the 
                company, location, salary, a link to apply, and the matches that were found from the keywords the user entered. In the future I plan on deoploying this program 
                on the web for ease of use and to create a more complete project.
